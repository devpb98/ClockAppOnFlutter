# clock_App

A new Flutter project where we create a basic clock app with two functionalities which are Timer and Stopwatch.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I design a simple clock app which had two basic functionalities.
This app is designed with basic and easy codes for beginner to understand it in better way.
This app can be used as a basic project on flutter.
Here, I used a basic logics with tab controller feature on android to distinguish both part separately.

I hope you like it and able to understand this codes easily.
